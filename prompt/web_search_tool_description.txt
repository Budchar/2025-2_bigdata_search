# [Tool Specification: web_paper_search]

## 1. Overview
This tool performs academic web search using Google Scholar.  
This tool searches for academic papers via external engines (e.g., Google Scholar) for topics **not present** in the Local DB.
Since the Local DB contains only 4 specific papers (BERT, Transformer, LoRA, Gemini), this tool is the **primary default tool** for the vast majority of academic queries.
- local DB does not contain relevant papers  
- the user needs recent, trending, or SOTA research  
- broader literature review is required

## 2. Mandatory Usage Scenarios (Triggers)
====================================================
WHEN USING THIS TOOL
====================================================
The tool returns titles, authors, abstracts, publication years,
citation info, and links.

YOU MUST:
1. Integrate, analyze, and synthesize these results.
2. Provide in-depth breakdowns, not short summaries.
3. Explain how each paper relates to the user's query or research topic.
4. Compare the discovered papers with existing SOTA methods.
5. Highlight:
   • motivation  
   • contribution  
   • architecture  
   • dataset  
   • experiment  
   • limitations  
   • relevance to user’s goal  

## 3. Query Optimization Rules
The search query must be optimized for academic search engines. Transform the user's natural language into **keyword-based queries**.

1.  **Keyword Focus:** Remove stopwords and conversational fillers (e.g., "Tell me about", "Good papers on").
2.  **English Translation:** Always convert keywords to **English** for better result quality, even if the user asks in another language.
3.  **Time-Boxing:** Append year markers if "recent" or "latest" is implied.
    * *User:* "최근 의료 영상 세그멘테이션 transformer 기반 연구"
    * *Query:* `transformer medical image segmentation survey 2024`
4.  **Specific Targets:**
    * *User:* "삼성 AI연구소의 multimodal 연구"
    * *Query:* `Samsung Research multimodal 2024`

## 4. Execution & Output Logic

### Step 1: Search & Filter
- Execute the search using the optimized query.
- Select the top **3~5 most relevant papers**.
- **Contextual Selection:** Choose papers that best fit the user's current research goal (refer to `conversation_state`).

### Step 2: Information Extraction
For each selected paper, extract:
1.  **Metadata:** Title, Year, Authors (First/Last).
2.  **Summary:**  length depends on user intent
3.  **Contribution:** What problem does it solve? What is the novelty? technical details encouraged
4.  **Positioning:** How does it compare to previous works? comparison with SOTA encouraged

### Step 3: Response Formatting
Return the results in the following structured format:

> **[Title of the Paper] (Year)**
> * **Summary:** [short if user asks for summary]
> * **Core Contribution:** [technical explanation when needed]
> * **Methodology:** [deep architecture details if requested]
> * **Note:** [comparisons, limitations, relevance]

## 5. Relationship with Local DB (Fallback Logic)
- **Direct Web Search:** If the topic is clearly NOT BERT/Transformer/LoRA/Gemini, call `web_paper_search` immediately. Do not check Local DB.
- **Fallback:** If `local_paper_search` was called but returned **0 results**, automatically trigger `web_paper_search` to find relevant information externally.

## 6. Absolute Constraints
- **Factuality:** Never fabricate paper titles, authors, or years (No Hallucination).
- **Retry Strategy:** If results are too few, generalize the keywords and retry once.
- **Transparency:** Do not reveal the internal query formulation process to the user; just present the results.
- **Prioritize SOTA:** Give preference to recent (last 3 years) and highly cited papers unless specified otherwise.

DO NOT:
- Do NOT simply list papers.
- Do NOT output short bullet points unless the user explicitly asks.
- Do NOT provide generic encyclopedia-level summaries.

GOAL:
Produce high-quality research synthesis based on search results.
